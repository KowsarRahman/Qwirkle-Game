# Qwirkle-Game
A C++ command line application for Assignment-2 of APT.

This was not an individual project. It was a group project with 3 of my classmates.

Fortunately we scored 23 out of 30 although we could have scored had we regularly updated our progress and reported it to the tutor. 

Each of us had a different role in it. Mine was to implement a Linked List for this Qwirkle game. 

## What is Qwirkle?

Qwirkle is a tile-based game for two to four players, designed by Susan McKinley Ross and published by MindWare. Qwirkle shares some characteristics with the games Rummikub and Scrabble. It is distributed in Canada by game and puzzle company Outset Media.
